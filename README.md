You have a set of Vendors devices classes like lights, garage door and so on.

We want to construct a class that will represent a remote control with N slots of devices to be paired.
Each slot will have and on/off button, mapped to an action to the associated device.

The remote control design must be flexible enough to allow us to change the actions associated to the on
off buttons every time we want.

The output of the program should be the mapping of the remote control actions and the output from pressing the buttons.
